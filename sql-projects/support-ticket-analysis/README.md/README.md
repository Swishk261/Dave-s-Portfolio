# Support Ticket Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

## 📌 Context
Tech Solutions Inc. has seen a drop in customer satisfaction over the past few months, shown in survey results and support tickets. This decline risks customer retention and company growth. Managers currently lack clear insights into why customers are dissatisfied.
This project will analyse customer feedback and support data to identify key issues, uncover trends, and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer experience and satisfaction.
## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- SQL: Data cleaning, joins, aggregation
- Tableau: Dashboard for ticket resolution times and workload insights

## 📊 Process
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, standardized categories  
2. **Joins:** Combined ticket details with agent data  
3. **Aggregation:** Calculated resolution times and ticket counts per agent  
4. **Visualization:** Built a Tableau dashboard to highlight bottlenecks  

## 📈 Results
- Identified agents with consistently high resolution times  
- Highlighted categories causing delays  
- Created a dashboard for managers to monitor workload distribution  

## 🎯 Teaching Takeaway
This case study demonstrates how **cleaning and joining messy support data** can reveal actionable insights for team efficiency.
