# Support Ticket Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## 📌 Context
This project creates an interactive Tableau dashboard to monitor support ticket resolution times, agent workload distribution, and identify operational bottlenecks in customer support operations.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- Tableau Dashboard: Interactive filters, KPIs, ticket segmentation
- Visual storytelling: Resolution time trends and workload analysis

## 📊 Process
1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned ticket records and standardized priority categories  
2. **Dashboard Design:** Built KPIs (avg resolution time, ticket volume, agent efficiency)  
3. **Interactive Features:** Created filters for date range, ticket type, and agent selection  

## 📈 Results
- Identified agents with consistently high resolution times for additional support  
- Highlighted ticket categories causing the most delays  
- Delivered a real-time dashboard for managers to monitor workload distribution
