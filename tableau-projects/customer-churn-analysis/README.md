# Customer Churn Analysis (Tableau)

## 📌 Context
Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription businesses. This project uses Tableau to visualize churn drivers and build a storytelling dashboard for decision-makers.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- Tableau Dashboard: Interactive filters, KPIs, churn segmentation
- Tableau Story: Narrative flow showing churn drivers and retention strategies

## 📊 Process
1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned customer records and standardized churn labels  
2. **Dashboard Design:** Built KPIs (churn %, retention rate, revenue impact)  
3. **Storytelling Flow:** Created a Tableau Story to guide stakeholders through churn drivers  

## 📈 Results
- Identified top churn drivers: contract length and customer support interactions  
- Highlighted retention opportunities: loyalty programs and proactive support outreach  
- Delivered a dashboard for executives to monitor churn in real time
